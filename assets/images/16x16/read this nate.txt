all of the tiles are grouped into types. 
Each is a 2x2 of four 16x16px tiles for a total of 16 tiles.

positions
1  2

3  4


For floor tiles:
A zone should have a majority of a single type. They can however have tiles from neighboring number.

1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4

the next zone should also be neighboring to the number of the current zone.


For wall tiles:
same rules apply for zone type transitions so they need to be neighboring.

wall ties for zones 1 and 2 are shared and 3 and 4 are shared but not between the two.

1 <-> 2 =/= 3 <-> 4

zones 1 and 2 also have special rules for wall tiles.

the bottom two tiles in each of the 2x2 zones are made to boarder the floor tiles.
these should only be used in that row and the tiles on the top of the 2x2s shouldn't be
used for the lowest row. 

message me if any of this doesn't make since.
